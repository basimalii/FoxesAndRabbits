This predator-prey simulation ('Foxes and Rabbits') leverages essential
Object-Oriented Programming concepts, including encapsulation and inheritance,
to model the interactions between foxes and rabbits. Built a user-friendly GUI with
Java Swing and ensured code reliability through rigorous JUnit testing.
